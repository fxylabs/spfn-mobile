No release has been made. Entries below describe repository state, not shipped
software.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — unreleased

Step 1 laid out the repository. Step 2 made it compile on both platforms and proved one
vertical slice end to end. Nothing is committed, tagged or published.

### Decided in Step 4 preparation

- License: MIT, Copyright FXY Inc. (decision D8, 2026-08-01), matching the upstream
  SPFN primitives repository.
- First release-train version: `0.1.0-alpha.1` (decision D9, 2026-08-01), lockstep
  across the SwiftPM tag and Maven version; 1.0.0 waits on Step 5 evidence.

### Added in Step 2

- Toolchain baseline from decision D5: swift-tools 6.0 with Swift 6 language mode,
  iOS 16 / macOS 13, Gradle 9.5.1, AGP 9.2.1, Kotlin 2.4.10, JDK 21 toolchain,
  minSdk 24, compileSdk 36.
- Gradle wrapper, with the distribution and the wrapper jar pinned to the SHA-256
  checksums gradle.org publishes for 9.5.1 (`gradle/wrapper/WRAPPER-PINS.json`).
- All five Android modules compile as AAR libraries; `spfn-core` and `spfn-auth` run
  unit tests.
- `gradle/verification-metadata.xml` populated with real, network-fetched checksums for
  every resolved artifact.
- A pinned `clientProofV1` contract bundle with a real SHA-256, recorded in
  `Contracts/upstream.lock.json` as locally authored rather than upstream-exported.
- `tools/contract-codegen`: a zero-network, deterministic generator that produces the
  Swift and Kotlin clients from that bundle in one run, refuses to run when the bundle
  digest does not match the lock, and stamps every output with the digest it read.
- Canonical JSON (SPFN-CANON-JSON-1) and clientProofV1 proof assembly, implemented
  independently on each platform.
- Conformance fixtures under `Contracts/fixtures/`, whose expected values come from a
  third implementation rather than from either SDK, and two test suites that consume
  the same files.
- Validator rules for wrapper checksums, contract provenance, generated-source
  traceability, the repository allowlist and the compatibility matrix.

### Added in Step 1

- SwiftPM manifest with five products and no external dependencies.
- Gradle multi-project root and five Android module shells.
- `tools/module-graph.json` as the single source of truth for the module graph.
- `tools/validate/validate.sh`, a zero-dependency offline validator.
- Contract placeholders under `Contracts/` with enforced placeholder discipline.
- An internal, unpublished CocoaPods compatibility fixture generated from the module graph.
- Five inert, manual-only CI workflow files; none is a gate.
- `docs/SCAFFOLD-STATUS.md` and `docs/OPEN-DECISIONS.md`.

### Still deliberately absent

An upstream-exported contract bundle (D17), transport, persistence, the hybrid bridge,
key custody, CODEOWNERS identities, signing identities, registry configuration,
pinned CI action SHAs, and every `COMPATIBILITY.md` support row. See
`docs/OPEN-DECISIONS.md`.
